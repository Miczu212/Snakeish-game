This is a little project of mine that i did to check myself if i understood the basics of sprite generating and stuff, i called it moron snake cause it aint exactly snake it somethin like conection of tetris and snake in one game
How to play, if u want to turn u have to hold down the arrow key in which direction u want to move, if u click q or e u will become | where normaly u are _ its not rotation it is what it is . there is also hidden hardcode mode to get into it u have to press h if it aint no working try holding it for a while, goal is to get to biggest highscore and thats basicly it
I havent made this from 0 to 100% i used Chili DirectX Framework (which i noticed at @ChiliTomatoNoodle yt channel i recomend cheking him out he does cool guides about the subject) because of that isnt mine but game that i made using it certainly is.
So thats about it, ENJOY!
