This is a little project of mine that i did to check myself if i understood the basics of sprite generating and stuff, i called it  snakeish game because it aint exactly snake its something like conection of tetris and snake in one game
How to play, if u want to turn Press arrow keys, if u click q or e u will become | where normaly u are _ its not rotation it is what it is . there is also hidden hardcode mode to get into it u have to press h if it isnt working try holding it for a while, goal is to get to biggest highscore and thats basicly it
I havent made this from 0 to 100% i used Chili DirectX Framework.
So thats about it, ENJOY!
